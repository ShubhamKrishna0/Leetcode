## 🚀 About

Welcome to my personal **DSA & Data Structures** repository!  
This is a curated collection of my learning journey through:

- 📌 Competitive Programming (CP)
- 📌 Core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- 📌 Leetcode / Codeforces / GFG / InterviewBit / Striver Sheet
- 📌 Real-World Problem Solving

Whether you're brushing up before interviews or preparing for contests, this repo can help you stay organized and motivated.
